## Description:

An ideal way for weekend warriors to find a watering hole based on 3 categories: cheap drinks, unique drinks, and great happy hours.
The user chooses their location based on their chosen category.
Then once at the location can, in real-time, check in and make a comment.
The check-in and comment is a way for new users to get an idea of what they may experience and can make a more informed decision on where to go
